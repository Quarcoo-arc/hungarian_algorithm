# Hungarian Algorithm - Frontend

## Steps to run

In your terminal

- Change directory to `frontend`

```bash
cd frontend
```

- Install packages (only for first time users)

```bash
npm install
```

- Create an environment variable called `VITE_BACKEND_URL` and assign it the url for the domain and port address of the backend api. It is `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default.

- Spin up your backend server.
  Follow the instructions here[../backend/README.md] to do so.

- Spin up the dev server.

```bash
npm run dev
```
